We can work together to build your organization a clean, performant, well-modeled product or service that helps to make positive change in the world.  My quest is to use technology to help improve outcomes for underserved individuals and communities.  Building supportive, diverse, cooperative engineering departments is essential for building great software that solves problems for humans, and it's my priority.

Iâ€™m a dual-wielding Rubyist and Javascripter with a love of friendly deploys and CI/CD.  I've revamped deploy pipelines, spearheaded pay equity initiatives, delivered APIs and microserves, and refactored complex data models.  I lead diversity, inclusion, collaboration, education and career development initiatives.  I drive cultural change and set high expectations for ownership and accountability.
