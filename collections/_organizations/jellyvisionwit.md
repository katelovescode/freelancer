In my time at Jellyvision, I co-founded and facilitated the Women in Tech employee resource group.  I had a direct impact on pay equity in partnership with executives, represented the company at industry events, recruited from diverse populations, and procured funding for underrepresented Jellyvision employees to attend conferences.  I mentored and spoke at several Code & Coffee events.
