At the Mom Project, I streamlined essential engineering functions:

* implemented a clear, iterative development process
* rolled out a bug report/feature request process for staff
* enacted a feature planning lifecycle based on user-focused product development
* initiated department meetings for transparency in hiring and product milestone planning
 
I rearchitected our existing application onto a more modern platform, using Rails 5, React, and Postgres. As a part of this process, I:

* dockerized the app for consistency of local development environments and simplification of deployment
* integrated AWS Cognito with Rails to leverage a robust authentication system to safeguard user information
* automated the testing and deployment process using CircleCI and Github
* planned and oversaw the implementation of containerized deployment through ECS using CloudFormation
* built a fully-featured REST API using Rails 5â€™s API-only capabilities

I also redesigned the data model in order to streamline queries and data handling:

* normalized data
* shedded unnecessary data collection
* offloaded some internal data processes to third-party proven services to simplify in-house data maintenance
